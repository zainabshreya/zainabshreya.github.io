                    <p>From growing up in poverty in the Southern United States to becoming one of the most successful businesswomen in the country, Madam C.J. Walker crashed all stereotypes. After dealing with financial stress, physical stress, and hair loss, Walker started her career working for African American businesswoman Annie Turnbo Malone as a sales agent. After getting married, she then decided to start her own business selling hair care products and straighteners for African American women with just $1.25. After years of hard work, some creative juices, and an entrepreneurial spirit, she was able to make it big with sales exceeding $500,000 in the final year of her life.</p>
